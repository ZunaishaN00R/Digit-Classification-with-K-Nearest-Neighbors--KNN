# Digit-Classification-with-K-Nearest-Neighbors--KNN
Efficiently classify digits (0 to 9) using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. Experiment with diverse k values, identifying the optimal k for maximum accuracy. Visualize model performance through a plotted confusion matrix and generate a comprehensive classification report.
